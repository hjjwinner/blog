`delete` is used to remove a properpty from an object.

{% highlight js %}
var a = {x: 2, y: 3};
delete a.x; // Returns true; `a` is changed to be {y: 3}
{% endhighlight %}

But there are circumstances that we may expect the wrong result from it. Here's what *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* tells us.

<blockquote>
<p>A <code>delete</code> expression evaluates to <code>true</code> if the delete succeeded or if the delete had no effect (such as deleting a nonexistent property). <code>delete</code> also evaluates to <code>true</code> when used (meaninglessly) with an expression that is not a property access expression:</p>

{% highlight js %}
o = {x:1};         // o has own property x and inherits property toString
delete o.x;        // Delete x, and return true
delete o.x;        // Do nothing (x doesn't exist), and return true
delete o.toString; // Do nothing (toString isn't an own property), return true
delete 1;          // Nonsense, but evaluates to true
delete a.x;        // returns true and `a` is changed to be {y: 3}
{% endhighlight %}

<p><code>delete</code> does not remove properties that have a configurable attribute of <code>false</code>. (Though it will remove configurable properties of nonextensible objects.) Certain properties of built-in objects are nonconfigurable, as are properties of the global object created by variable declaration and function declaration. In strict mode, attempting to delete a nonconfigurable property causes a TypeError. In non-strict mode (and in ECMAScript 3), <code>delete</code> simply evaluates to <code>false</code> in this case:</p>

{% highlight js %}
delete Object.prototype; // Can't delete; property is non-configurable
var x = 1;               // Declare a global variable
delete this.x;           // Can't delete this property
function f() {}          // Declare a global function
delete this.f;           // Can't delete this property either
{% endhighlight %}

<p><em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 6th Edition</em></p>
</blockquote>

As mentioned several times above, what is *configurable*?

> The *configurable* attribute controls at the same time whether the property can be deleted from the object and whether its attributes (other than writable) can be changed.

Be careful when deleting on global objects. Here are some interesting results that may be confusing.

{% highlight js %}
// In global scope
var x = 1;  delete this.x; // Returns false;
y = 1;      delete this.y; // Returns true;
this.z = 1; delete this.z; // Returns true;

var x = 1;  delete x;      // Returns false;
y = 1;      delete y;      // Returns true;
this.z = 1; delete z;      // Returns true;
{% endhighlight %}

Why? How is `x` different from `y` in this case?

We know that `y`, an undeclared variable can be used in almost the same way like declared variables like `x`. Then, how are they different in this case?

<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1306809/matt-coughlin" target="_blank">Matt Coughlin</a> gives a very clear <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15985875/effect-of-declared-and-undeclared-variables#answer-16007360" target="_blank">answer</a> to this question, which I'd suggest reading. To be brief, for declared global variables, the *configurable* attribute is `false`. For undeclared global variables, it's `true`. And properties can be deleted only when it's `configurable` attribute is `true`.
