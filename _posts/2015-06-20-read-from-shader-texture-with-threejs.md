<a href="https://www.opengl.org/documentation/glsl/" target="_blank">GLSL</a> is the OpenGL Shading Language, with which we can write amazing shaders like those on <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/" target="_blank">Shadertoy</a>.

With <a href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a>, the process of writing shaders is made much easier. You may write shader programs by yourself as the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/2761f1b161c2da0d46a1bf2feb7fa374d0708108/examples/webgl_shader.html#L54" target="_blank">example</a> shows. On the other hand, Three.js provides many <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/js/shaders" target="_blank">frequently used shaders</a> so that you can apply shader effects by simply doing like this.

In this post, we are going to introduce how to use `THREE.ShaderPass` to write shaders for video from local camera and get pixel data from the rendered composer. We will take `THREE.EdgeShader` as example and read the rendered edges from it.

We are going to introduce in the following steps.

1.	Render local video to a plane in Three.js

	1.1	Including files and set up environments  
	1.2	Getting video from local camera using `getUserMedia`  
	1.3	Creating a plane and use video as texture

2.	Set `THREE.EdgeShader` to video texture

	2.1	Including shader files  
	2.2	Using `Three.EffectComposer`  
	2.3	Reading pixels

By the end of this post, you will be able to implement the effect at <a href="{{ site.url }}/demo/2015-06-20-read-from-shader-texture-with-threejs-05.html" target="_blank">demo 2.3</a> and get the number of non-zero pixels on the screen.





# 1. Render local video to a plane in Three.js

The result of this step is available at <a href="{{ site.url }}/demo/2015-06-20-read-from-shader-texture-with-threejs-03.html" target="_blank">demo 1.3</a>.

## 1.1 Including files and set up environments

If you are familiar with Three.js, this step may looks extremly easy for you.

We include the `three.js` file from <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/build" target="_blank">build directory</a> of Three.js repo on GitHub. And set up Three.js environment very simply, and create a canvas of size `400x300px`.

## 1.2 Getting video from local camera using `getUserMedia`

Next, we use `navigator.getUserMedia` to get the access to local camers.

{% highlight js %}
// local video
var video = document.createElement('video');
navigator.getUserMedia = navigator.getUserMedia 
	|| navigator.webkitGetUserMedia
    || navigator.mozGetUserMedia
    || navigator.msGetUserMedia;

if (navigator.getUserMedia) {
    navigator.getUserMedia({
        video: true
    }, function (stream) {
        video.src = window.URL.createObjectURL(stream);
        video.onloadedmetadata = function(e) {
            video.play();
        };
        video.width = canvas.width;
        video.height = canvas.height;
    }, function (err) {
        alert('Request camera failed');
    });
} else {
    alert('getUserMedia not supported');
}

## 1.3 Creating a plane and use video as texture

Next, we need to draw the video onto the canvas using Three.js. You may probably ask why not draw using canvas. This is because we will add shader effects afterwards, and thus we have to draw it using WebGL, which is in our case, using Three.js.

We first create a canvas named `videoImage` to draw the video onto. And then create a `THREE.Texture` named `videoTexture`, which is used as the map of the material of a plane whose position is just about the screen.

{% highlight js %}
var videoImage = document.createElement('canvas');
videoImage.width = canvas.width;
videoImage.height = canvas.height;

var videoImageContext = videoImage.getContext('2d');
// background color if no video present
videoImageContext.fillStyle = '#ff0000';
videoImageContext.fillRect(0, 0,
    videoImage.width, videoImage.height);

videoTexture = new THREE.Texture(videoImage);
videoTexture.minFilter = THREE.LinearFilter;
videoTexture.magFilter = THREE.LinearFilter;

var videoMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
    map: videoTexture,
    overdraw: true
});
var videoGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(4, 3);
var videoMesh = new THREE.Mesh(videoGeometry, videoMaterial);
videoMesh.position.set(0, 0, 0);
tmpScene.add(videoMesh);
{% endhighlight %}

Slow down to understand the above code carefully. And ask yourself, how is `video` passed to all these elements?

The answer is that we need to modify the callback function `video.onloadedmetadata`. In the following lines of code, `this.videoWidth` and `this.videoHeight` are the size of local camera, and we set that of canvas `videoImage` to be the same, so that the canvas renders only the video content, and without any black area. This is very important since it may bring about problems of position if we don't do so.

Note that we set `videoTexture.needsUpdate` to be `true` so that when our renderer renders the plane with `videoTexture`, it knows the texture should be updated.

{% highlight js %}
video.onloadedmetadata = function(e) {
    videoImage.width = this.videoWidth;
    videoImage.height = this.videoHeight;
    video.play();

    renderFrame();
};

function renderFrame() {
    videoImageContext.drawImage(video, 0, 0);
    if (videoTexture) {
        videoTexture.needsUpdate = true;
    }
    renderer.render(tmpScene, camera);
    requestAnimationFrame(renderFrame);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, we can see the effect of rendering local camera at <a href="{{ site.url }}/demo/2015-06-20-read-from-shader-texture-with-threejs-03.html" target="_blank">demo 1.3</a>.





# 2. Set `THREE.EdgeShader` to video texture

## 2.1 Including shader files

Three.js shader files are available at <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/js/shaders" target="_blank">examples/js/shaders</a>, which are not part of `three.js` or `three.min.js` in `build` directory. To use them, we need to include the corresponding files.

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="./three.CopyShader.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./three.EdgeShader.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./three.EffectComposer.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./three.MaskPass.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./three.RenderPass.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./three.ShaderPass.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}



## 2.2 Using `Three.EffectComposer`

Then, we create several passes to enable the shader effect.

{% highlight js %}
var renderPass = new THREE.RenderPass(tmpScene, camera);

var edgeShader = new THREE.ShaderPass(THREE.EdgeShader);

var effectCopy = new THREE.ShaderPass(THREE.CopyShader);
effectCopy.renderToScreen = true;

var composer = new THREE.EffectComposer(renderer);
composer.addPass(renderPass);
composer.addPass(edgeShader);
composer.addPass(effectCopy);
{% endhighlight %}

These passes work like a pipe. `RenderPass` passes the rendered texture in `tmpScene` to `EdgeShader`. `EdgeShader` uses edge detect algorithm to modify the edges in the texture to be white and other to be black, then passes to `CopyShader` to copy to screen. `EffectComposer` is used to compose these three passes and form into a pipeline.

And next, use `composer.render();` instead of `renderer.render(tmpScene, camera);`.

Now, you are supposed to get something like this... if you are as cute as me! :joy:



## 2.3 Reading pixels

Then, we can read the pixels from this canvas to get pixel information from GPU to CPU. 

**CAUTION!! This is extremely time-consuming!!**

Then why?

Well, I guess this is not a very common requirement. So when I searched for this solution, I hardly found any. And this is also why I write this post. I will use the pixel data to form vertices on the edges to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Delaunay_triangulation" target="_blank">Delaunay Triangles</a>. So I guess this is a must-be-paid large cost.

In `renderFrame`, we add the following lines to read pixels.

{% highlight js %}
var pixels = new Uint8Array(canvas.width * canvas.height * 4);
var gl = renderer.getContext();
gl.readPixels(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height, gl.RGBA, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, pixels);
{% endhighlight %}

Here, `pixels` is a one-dimensional arrary that contains colors in the order of `[red1, green1, blue1, alpha1, red2, green2, blue2, alpha2, ...]`. So we can output the count of non-zero red elements to make sure the pixels are read correctly.

{% highlight js %}
function getNonZeroCnt(arr) {
    var cnt = 0;
    for (var i = 0, len = arr.length; i < len; i += 4) {
        if (arr[i] > 0) {
            ++cnt;
        }
    }
    return cnt;
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Conclusion

This post provides a solution to get pixels from canvas rendered using `EffectComposer`.
